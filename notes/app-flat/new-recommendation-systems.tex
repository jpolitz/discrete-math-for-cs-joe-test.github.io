In the table  below,  each row represents a user's ratings of movies: 
\cmark~(check) indicates the person liked the movie, \xmark~(x)
that they didn't, and $\bullet$ (dot) that they didn't rate it one way or 
another (neutral rating or didn't watch). Can encode
these ratings numerically with $1$ for \cmark~(check), $-1$ for \xmark~(x), 
and $0$ for $\bullet$ (dot).

\section*{Defining sets}


{\it To define sets:}

To define a set using {\bf roster method}, explicitly list its elements. That is,
start with $\{$ then list elements of 
the set separated by commas and close with $\}$.

To define a set using {\bf set builder definition}, either form 
``The set of all $x$ from the universe $U$ such that $x$ is ..." by writing
\[\{x \in U \mid ...x... \}\]
or form ``the collection of all outputs of some operation when the input ranges over the universe $U$"
by writing
\[\{ ...x... \mid x\in U \}\]

We use the symbol $\in$ as ``is an element of'' to indicate membership in a set.\\


{\bf Example sets}: For each of the following, identify whether it's defined using the roster method
or set builder notation and give an example element.
\begin{itemize}
    \item[]$\{ -1, 1\}$\\
    \item[]$\{0, 0 \}$\\
    \item[]$\{-1, 0, 1 \}$\\
    \item[]$\{(x,x,x) \mid x \in \{-1,0,1\} \}$\\
    \item[]$\{ \}$\\
    \item[]$\{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \geq 0 \}$\\
    \item[]$\{ x \in \mathbb{Z}  \mid x > 0 \}$\\
    \item[]$\{\A,\C,\U,\G\}$ \\
    \item[]$\{\A\U\G, \U\A\G, \U\G\A, \U\A\A \}$\\

\section*{Defining functions ratings}


Recall our representation of Netflix users' ratings of movies as $n$-tuples, where
$n$ is the number of movies in the database. 
Each component of the $n$-tuple is $-1$ (didn't like the movie), $0$ 
(neutral rating or didn't watch the movie), or $1$ (liked the movie).

Consider the ratings $P_1 = (-1, 0, 1)$, $P_2 = (1, 1, -1)$, $P_3 = (1, 1, 1)$,
$P_4 = (0,-1,1)$


Which of $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$ has movie preferences most similar to $P_4$?

One approach to answer this question: use {\bf functions} to define distance between user preferences.

For example, consider the function 
$d_0: \phantom{the Cartesian product of the set of ratings on 3 movies with itself} \to \phantom{\mathbb{R}}$
given by
\[
d_0 (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3), (y_1, y_2, y_3) ~) ~) = \sqrt{ (x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 -y_3)^2}
\]


\vfill
\vfill


{\it Extra example:} A new movie is released, and $P_1$ and $P_2$ watch it before $P_3$, and give it
ratings; $P_1$ gives \cmark~and $P_2$ gives \xmark.
Should this movie be recommended to $P_3$? Why or why not?

{\it Extra example:} Define a new function that could be used to compare the $4$-tuples of ratings encoding
movie preferences now that there are four movies in the database.
