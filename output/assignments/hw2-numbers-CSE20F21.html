<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will consider multiple number representations and how they
connect to applications in computer science. You will also practice
tracing and working with algorithms.</p>
<p>Instructions and academic integrity reminders for all homework
assignments in CSE20 this quarter are on the class website and on the
hw1-definitions-and-notations assignment.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw2-numbers”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are
working with for this assignment, see the class material from Friday of
Week 1 and Monday and Wednesday of Week 2. We will post frequently asked
questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span><a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) Pick a nonnegative integer between
100 and 1000 (inclusive) and express it using at least three different
representations, at least two of which must be ones discussed in class.
Include at least one trace of using procedure <span
class="math inline">\(baseb1\)</span> from page 16 of the Week 0 and 1
notes to calculate the base <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>
expansion of your number (for your choice of <span
class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>) and include at least one trace of
using procedure <span class="math inline">\(baseb2\)</span> from page 16
of the Week 0 and 1 notes to calculate the base <span
class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span> expansion of your number (for your
choice of <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span>).</p>
<p><span><em>Extra; not for credit:</em></span> Consider choosing
representations that might be useful in some way; what would make one
representation more useful than another?</p></li>
<li><p>In this question, we will use recursive definitions to give a
precise description of the set of strings that form octal (base <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span>) expansions and the values of those
expansions. Let’s start by defining the set of possible coefficients
<span class="math display">\[C_8 = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7\}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) Fill
in the recursive definition of the set of all strings that form octal
expansions, <span class="math inline">\(S_8\)</span>:</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span> The set <span
class="math inline">\(S_8\)</span> is defined (recursively) by: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ll}
    \textrm{Basis Step: } &amp; \textrm{If } x \in
\underline{\phantom{\hspace{2in}}} \textrm{, then } x \in S_8\\
    \textrm{Recursive Step: } &amp; \textrm{If } s \in S_8 \textrm{ and
} x \in C_8 \textrm{, then }
    \underline{\phantom{\hspace{2in}}} \in S_8
    \end{array}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span><a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>)
Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(v_8: S_8 \to
\mathbb{Z}^+\)</span> defined recursively by</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basis Step: If <span class="math inline">\(x \in C_8\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\(v_8 (x) = x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Recursive Step: If <span class="math inline">\(s \in S_8\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(x \in C_8\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(v_8 (sx) = 8v_8(s) + x\)</span>, where the input
<span class="math inline">\(sx\)</span> is the result of string
concatenation and the output <span class="math inline">\(8 v_8
(s)\)</span> is the result of integer multiplication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calculate <span class="math inline">\(v_8(104)\)</span>, including
all steps in your calculation and justifications for them.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) It
turns out<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that for any string <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(S_8\)</span>, the value of the octal expansion
<span class="math inline">\((u)_8\)</span> equals <span
class="math inline">\(v_8(u)\)</span>. Using this fact, write an
expression relating the value of <span
class="math inline">\((u000)_8\)</span> to the value of <span
class="math inline">\((u)_8\)</span> and justify it.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Recall that,
mathematically, a color can be represented as a <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\((r,
g, b)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> represents
the red component, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> the green
component, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the blue component and
where each of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
must be from the collection <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{N}\mid 0 \leq x \leq 255 \}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As an <span><strong>alternative</strong></span> representation, in
this assignment we’ll use base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span>
fixed-width expansions to represent colors as single numbers.</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span>: A <span><strong>hex
color</strong></span> is a nonnegative integer less than or equal to
<span class="math inline">\(16777215\)</span>. For <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> a hex color, we define its red, green,
and blue components by first writing its base <span
class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> expansion <span
class="math display">\[n = (r_1r_2g_1g_2b_1b_2)_{16,6}\]</span> and then
defining <span class="math inline">\((r_1r_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the red
component, <span class="math inline">\((g_1g_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the
green component, and <span
class="math inline">\((b_1b_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the blue
component.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the
detail expected in your answer:</em></span></p>
<p>In RGB codes<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> white is represented as maximum red,
maximum green, and maximum blue and so has <span
class="math inline">\((FF)_{16,2}\)</span> as each of these components.
This means that the hex color for white is <span
class="math inline">\((FFFFFF)_{16,6}\)</span> which is the value <span
class="math display">\[15\cdot 16^5 + 15 \cdot 16^4 + 15 \cdot 16^3 + 15
\cdot 16^2 + 15 \cdot 16^1 + 15 \cdot 16^0
        = 16^6 - 1 = 16777215\]</span></p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p>Write the hex color representing red (with no green or blue) in
base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> and also calculate its value (using
usual mathematical conventions). Include your (clear, correct, complete)
calculations.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the hex color representing green (with no red or blue) in
base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> and also calculate its value (using
usual mathematical conventions). Include your (clear, correct, complete)
calculations.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the hex color representing blue (with no red or green) in
base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> and also calculate its values (using
usual mathematical conventions). Include your (clear, correct, complete)
calculations.</p></li>
<li><p>The human eye can’t distinguish between some hex colors because
of physical limitations. Give an example of two hex colors <span
class="math inline">\(c_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c_2\)</span> such that they look indistinguishable
(the colors they represent are very very similar) but <span
class="math display">\[c_1 - c_2 &gt; 50000\]</span> Justify your choice
with (clear, correct, complete) calculations and/or references to
definitions, and connecting these calculations and/or definitions with
the desired properties. Include squares with each of your two colors so
that we can see how indistinguishable they are.</p>
<p>Pro tip: To show a color, you can use the following LaTeX source
code:</p>
<p><code>\definecolor{UCSDaccent}{RGB}{0,198,215}</code></p>
<p><code>\textcolor{UCSDaccent}{\rule{1cm}{1cm}}</code></p>
<p>which produces</p>
<div style="color: UCSDaccent">
<hr />
</div>
<p>Notice that the code to define the color uses the decimal-like values
for each of the red, green, and blue components. For the UCSD accent
color we defined, the base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span>
fixed-width <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> values are: red is
<span class="math inline">\((00)_{16,2}\)</span>, green is <span
class="math inline">\((C6)_{16,2}\)</span>, blue is <span
class="math inline">\((D7)_{16,2}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Extra; not for credit:</em></span> What does this mean
about the choice of hex color for representing colors? What are
advantages and disadvantages of this representation?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In class (Week 2
notes page 7), we discussed fixed-width addition. In this question we
will look at fixed-width multiplication. The algorithm for fixed-width
multiplication is to multiply using the usual long-multiplication
algorithm (column-by-column and carry), and dropping all leftmost
columns so the result is the same width as the input terms. For each of
the examples below, consider whether this algorithm gives the correct
value for the product of the two numbers, based on the way the
bitstrings are interpreted.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the
detail expected in your answer:</em></span></p>
<p>The fixed-width <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> multiplication
of <span class="math inline">\([00101]_{2c,5}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\([00101]_{2c,5}\)</span> does not give the correct
value for the product, as we can see from the following calculation.</p>
<p>First, we calculate the values: <span
class="math display">\[[00101]_{2c,5} = 0\cdot (-2^4) + 0\cdot 2^3 + 1
\cdot 2^2 + 0\cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = 4 + 1 = 5\]</span> so the correct
value for the product is <span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 5 =
25\)</span>, which cannot be represented in 2s complement width 5 (the
largest positive number that can be represented in 2s complement width 5
is <span class="math inline">\([01111]_{2c,5} = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 =
15\)</span>).</p>
<p>When we perform the fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> multiplication algorithm: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            &amp; 0~ 0~ 1~ 0~ 1\\
     \times &amp; 0~ 0~ 1~ 0~ 1\\
     &amp;\overline{0~ 0~ 1~ 0~ 1}\\
     + {0~} &amp; {0~0~0~0~~}\\
     + {0~0~} &amp; {1~0~1~~}\\
     \overline{\phantom{0~0~}}&amp;\overline{1~ 1~ 0~ 0~ 1}\\
    \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>we get <span class="math inline">\([11001]_{2c,5} = 1\cdot (-2^4) + 1
\cdot 2^3 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = -16 + 8 + 1 =
-7\)</span>, which is not the required value.</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p>Does the fixed-width <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>
multiplication of <span class="math inline">\([11101]_{2c,5}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\([11011]_{2c,5}\)</span> give the correct
value for the product? Justify your answer with (clear, correct,
complete) calculations and/or references to definitions, and connecting
these calculations and/or definitions with your answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Does the fixed-width <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>
multiplication of <span class="math inline">\([00100]_{2c,5}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\([11100]_{2c,5}\)</span> give the correct
value for the product? Justify your answer with (clear, correct,
