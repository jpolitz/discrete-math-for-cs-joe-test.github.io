<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying definitions to get comfortable
working with mathematical language. As a result, you can expect to spend
more time reading the questions and looking up notation than doing
calculations.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3
students. You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The
lowest HW score will not be included in your overall HW average. Please
ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of
your homework submission.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. Diagrams may be
hand-drawn and scanned and included in the typed document. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your
group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours
(of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes
viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online
resources about the course content other than the class material from
this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent
notation and definitions we will use this quarter.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw1-definitions-and-notation”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are
working with for this assignment, see the class material from Week 0 and
1. We will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a
pinned Piazza post.</p>

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span><a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>)
Each of the sets below is described using set builder notation or as a
result of set operations applied to other known sets. Rewrite them using
the roster method.</p>
<p>Remember our discussions of data-types: use clear notation that is
consistent with our class notes and definitions to communicate the
data-types of the elements in each set.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the
detail expected in your answer:</em></span></p>
<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(\{ \texttt{A}\} \circ \{
\texttt{A}\texttt{U}, \texttt{A}\texttt{C},
\texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\)</span> can be written using the roster method
as <span class="math display">\[\{ \texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{U},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{C},
\texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\]</span> because set-wise concatenation
gives a set whose elements are all possible results of concatenating an
element of the left set with an element of the right set. Since the left
set in this example only has one element (<span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>), each of the elements of the
set we described starts with <span
class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>. There are three elements of
this set, one for each of the distinct elements of the right set.</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math display">\[\{ x \in S \mid rnalen(x) = 1 \}
\circ \{x \in S \mid rnalen(x) = 1 \}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the set of RNA strands and <span
class="math inline">\(rnalen\)</span> is the recursively defined
function that we discussed in class.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math display">\[\{ (r,g,b) \in C \mid r+g+b =
1\}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(C = \{ (r,g,b) \mid 0
\leq r \leq 255, 0 \leq g \leq 255, 0 \leq b \leq 255, r \in \mathbb{N},
g \in \mathbb{N}, b \in \mathbb{N} \}\)</span> is the set that you
worked with in Monday’s review quiz.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p>In Wednesday’s review quiz, you considered some attempted
recursive definitions for the function with domain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and with codomain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> which gives <span
class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span> for each <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Write out a correct recursive
definition of this function.</p></li>
<li><p>How would your answer to part (a) change if we consider a new
function with the same domain and rule but whose codomain is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>How would your answer to part (a) change if we consider a new
function with the same codomain and rule but whose domain is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a recursive definition of the function with domain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^+\)</span>, codomain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^+\)</span> and which gives <span
class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> for each <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. The <span
class="math inline">\(!\)</span> symbol is the “factorial” symbol and
means that we need to multiple <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> by
each of the integers between it and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> inclusive. For example, <span
class="math inline">\(5! = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 =
120\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Recall the
function <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> which takes an ordered
pair of ratings <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples and
returns a measure of the distance between them given by <span
class="math display">\[d_0 (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3), (y_1, y_2, y_3) ~) ~) =
\sqrt{ (x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 -y_3)^2}\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the

<p>To give an example of two <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples that are <span
class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> distance <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> from each other, consider the <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples <span
class="math inline">\((1,0,0)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((0,0,0)\)</span>. We calculate the function
application: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    d_0 (~(~ (1, 0,0), (0,0,0) ~) ~) &amp;= \sqrt{ (1 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2
+ (0 -0)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{1} =
1,\end{aligned}\]</span> which is the result required for this
example.</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p>Give an example of three <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    &amp;(x_{1,1}, x_{1,2}, x_{1,3}) \\
    &amp;(x_{2,1}, x_{2,2}, x_{2,3}) \\
    &amp;(x_{3,1}, x_{3,2}, x_{3,3}) \\
    \end{aligned}\]</span> that are all <span
class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> distance <span><strong>greater
than</strong></span> <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> from each
other. In other words, for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> between <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(i
\neq j\)</span>), <span class="math display">\[d_{0}(~(~(x_{i,1},
x_{i,2}, x_{i,3})  , (x_{j,1}, x_{j,2}, x_{j,3})~)~) &gt; 1\]</span></p>
<p>Your answer should include <span><strong>both</strong></span>
specific values for each example <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span><strong>and</strong></span>
a justification of your examples with (clear, correct, complete)
calculations and/or references to definitions and connecting them with
the desired conclusion.<br />
<span><em>To think about</em></span>: how will you justify that the
square root of a number is greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>? Are calculations from a calculator
accurate enough to help us?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the range of values that results from applying the
function <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> to ordered pairs of
<span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple ratings? That is, what are
the smallest and largest possible results?</p>

<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will consider multiple number representations and how they
connect to applications in computer science. You will also practice
tracing and working with algorithms.</p>
<p>Instructions and academic integrity reminders for all homework

<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are

<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span><a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>) Pick a nonnegative integer between
100 and 1000 (inclusive) and express it using at least three different
representations, at least two of which must be ones discussed in class.
Include at least one trace of using procedure <span
class="math inline">\(baseb1\)</span> from page 16 of the Week 0 and 1
notes to calculate the base <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>
expansion of your number (for your choice of <span
class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>) and include at least one trace of
using procedure <span class="math inline">\(baseb2\)</span> from page 16
of the Week 0 and 1 notes to calculate the base <span
class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span> expansion of your number (for your
choice of <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span>).</p>
<p><span><em>Extra; not for credit:</em></span> Consider choosing
representations that might be useful in some way; what would make one
representation more useful than another?</p></li>
<li><p>In this question, we will use recursive definitions to give a
precise description of the set of strings that form octal (base <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span>) expansions and the values of those
expansions. Let’s start by defining the set of possible coefficients
<span class="math display">\[C_8 = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7\}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) Fill
in the recursive definition of the set of all strings that form octal
expansions, <span class="math inline">\(S_8\)</span>:</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span> The set <span
class="math inline">\(S_8\)</span> is defined (recursively) by: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ll}
    \textrm{Basis Step: } &amp; \textrm{If } x \in
\underline{\phantom{\hspace{2in}}} \textrm{, then } x \in S_8\\
    \textrm{Recursive Step: } &amp; \textrm{If } s \in S_8 \textrm{ and
} x \in C_8 \textrm{, then }
    \underline{\phantom{\hspace{2in}}} \in S_8
    \end{array}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span><a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>)
Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(v_8: S_8 \to
\mathbb{Z}^+\)</span> defined recursively by</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basis Step: If <span class="math inline">\(x \in C_8\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\(v_8 (x) = x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Recursive Step: If <span class="math inline">\(s \in S_8\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(x \in C_8\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(v_8 (sx) = 8v_8(s) + x\)</span>, where the input
<span class="math inline">\(sx\)</span> is the result of string
concatenation and the output <span class="math inline">\(8 v_8
(s)\)</span> is the result of integer multiplication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calculate <span class="math inline">\(v_8(104)\)</span>, including
all steps in your calculation and justifications for them.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) It
turns out<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> that for any string <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(S_8\)</span>, the value of the octal expansion
<span class="math inline">\((u)_8\)</span> equals <span
class="math inline">\(v_8(u)\)</span>. Using this fact, write an
expression relating the value of <span
class="math inline">\((u000)_8\)</span> to the value of <span
class="math inline">\((u)_8\)</span> and justify it.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Recall that,
mathematically, a color can be represented as a <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\((r,
g, b)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> represents
the red component, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> the green
component, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the blue component and
where each of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
must be from the collection <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{N}\mid 0 \leq x \leq 255 \}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As an <span><strong>alternative</strong></span> representation, in
this assignment we’ll use base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span>
fixed-width expansions to represent colors as single numbers.</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span>: A <span><strong>hex
color</strong></span> is a nonnegative integer less than or equal to
<span class="math inline">\(16777215\)</span>. For <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> a hex color, we define its red, green,
and blue components by first writing its base <span
class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> expansion <span
class="math display">\[n = (r_1r_2g_1g_2b_1b_2)_{16,6}\]</span> and then
defining <span class="math inline">\((r_1r_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the red
component, <span class="math inline">\((g_1g_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the
green component, and <span
class="math inline">\((b_1b_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the blue
component.</p>

<p>In RGB codes<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> white is represented as maximum red,
maximum green, and maximum blue and so has <span
class="math inline">\((FF)_{16,2}\)</span> as each of these components.
This means that the hex color for white is <span
class="math inline">\((FFFFFF)_{16,6}\)</span> which is the value <span

<p>Pro tip: To show a color, you can use the following LaTeX source
code:</p>
<p><code>\definecolor{UCSDaccent}{RGB}{0,198,215}</code></p>
<p><code>\textcolor{UCSDaccent}{\rule{1cm}{1cm}}</code></p>
<p>which produces</p>
<div style="color: UCSDaccent">

<p>Notice that the code to define the color uses the decimal-like values
for each of the red, green, and blue components. For the UCSD accent
color we defined, the base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span>

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In class (Week 2
notes page 7), we discussed fixed-width addition. In this question we
will look at fixed-width multiplication. The algorithm for fixed-width
multiplication is to multiply using the usual long-multiplication
algorithm (column-by-column and carry), and dropping all leftmost
columns so the result is the same width as the input terms. For each of
the examples below, consider whether this algorithm gives the correct
value for the product of the two numbers, based on the way the
bitstrings are interpreted.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the
detail expected in your answer:</em></span></p>
<p>The fixed-width <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> multiplication
of <span class="math inline">\([00101]_{2c,5}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\([00101]_{2c,5}\)</span> does not give the correct
value for the product, as we can see from the following calculation.</p>
<p>First, we calculate the values: <span
class="math display">\[[00101]_{2c,5} = 0\cdot (-2^4) + 0\cdot 2^3 + 1
\cdot 2^2 + 0\cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = 4 + 1 = 5\]</span> so the correct
value for the product is <span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 5 =
25\)</span>, which cannot be represented in 2s complement width 5 (the
largest positive number that can be represented in 2s complement width 5
is <span class="math inline">\([01111]_{2c,5} = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 =
15\)</span>).</p>
<p>When we perform the fixed-width <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> multiplication algorithm: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            &amp; 0~ 0~ 1~ 0~ 1\\

     \overline{\phantom{0~0~}}&amp;\overline{1~ 1~ 0~ 0~ 1}\\
    \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>we get <span class="math inline">\([11001]_{2c,5} = 1\cdot (-2^4) + 1
\cdot 2^3 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = -16 + 8 + 1 =

<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will consider how circuits and logic can be used to represent

<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Imagine a friend suggests the following argument to you: “The
compound proposition <span class="math display">\[(x \to y) \to
z\]</span> is logically equivalent to <span class="math display">\[x \to
(y \to z)\]</span> because I can transform one to the other using the
following sequence of logical equivalences like distributivity and
associativity and using that <span class="math inline">\((p \to q)
\equiv (\lnot p \lor q)\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[(x \to y)
\to z \equiv
      \lnot (\lnot x \lor y) \lor z \equiv
      \lnot x \lor (\lnot y \lor z) \equiv
      x \to (\lnot y \lor z) \equiv x \to (y \to z)\]</span> so
conditionals are associative just like conjunctions and
disjunctions".</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span><a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>)
Prove to your friend that they made a mistake by giving a truth
assignment to the propositional variables where the two compound
propositions <span class="math inline">\((x \to y) \to z\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(x \to (y \to z)\)</span> have different
truth values. Justify your choice by evaluating these compound
propositions using the definitions of the logical connectives and
include enough intermediate steps so that a student in CSE 20 who may be
struggling with the material can still follow along with your
reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span><a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>) Help your friend find the problem
in their argument by pointing out which step(s) were incorrect.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) Give
<span><strong>three</strong></span> different compound propositions that
are actually logically equivalent to (and not the same as) <span
class="math display">\[x \to (y \to z)\]</span> Justify each one of
these logical equivalences either by applying a sequence of logical
equivalences or using a truth table. Notice that you can use other
logical operators (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\lnot, \lor, \land,

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness of choice and fair effort

(viii) is being <span><strong>disproved</strong></span> by the following
proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To disprove the statement, we will prove the universal statement that
is logically equivalent to its negation. By universal generalization,
<span><strong>choose</strong></span> <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> to be an
<span><strong>arbitrary</strong></span> integer. We need to find a
<span><strong>witness</strong></span> integer <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(y
\leq e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lnot Pr(y)\)</span>.
Notice that <span class="math inline">\(e &gt; 1 \lor e \leq 1\)</span>
is true, and we proceed in a <span><strong>proof by
cases</strong></span>. <span><strong>Case 1</strong></span>: Assume
<span class="math inline">\(e &gt; 1\)</span> and
<span><strong>WTS</strong></span> there is a witness integer <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(y
\leq e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lnot Pr(y)\)</span>.
Choose <span class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span>, an integer. Then,
since by <span><strong>case assumption</strong></span> <span
class="math inline">\(1 &lt; e\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(y = 0 \leq 1 \leq e\)</span>. Moreover, since
<span class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y &gt; 1\)</span> is false and so (by the
definition of <span class="math inline">\(Pr\)</span>), the predicate
<span class="math inline">\(Pr\)</span> evaluated at <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is false, as required to prove the
<span><strong>conjunction</strong></span> <span class="math inline">\(y
\leq e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lnot Pr(y)\)</span>.
<span><strong>Case 2</strong></span>: Assume <span
class="math inline">\(e \leq 1\)</span> and
<span><strong>WTS</strong></span> there is a witness integer <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(y
\leq e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lnot Pr(y)\)</span>.
Choose <span class="math inline">\(y = e-1\)</span>, an integer (because
subtracting <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> from the integer
<span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> still gives an integer). By
definition of subtraction, <span class="math inline">\(y = e-1 \leq
e\)</span>. Moreover, since by the <span><strong>case
assumption</strong></span> <span class="math inline">\(y = e-1 \leq 1-1=
0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y &gt; 1\)</span> is false.
Thus, (by the definition of <span class="math inline">\(Pr\)</span>),
the predicate <span class="math inline">\(Pr\)</span> evaluated at <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is false. We have proved the
<span><strong>conjunction</strong></span> <span class="math inline">\(y
\leq e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lnot Pr(y)\)</span> as
required. Since each case is complete, the proof by cases is complete

\} \cap \{ X \in W ~|~  2 \in X \}~~)\]</span> consider <span

valid witness, we need to show that it is in the domain of

the predicate being quantified evaluate to true. By definition of
set-builder notation and intersection, it’s enough to prove that <span

class="math inline">\(1 \in \{1,2\}\)</span> and that <span
class="math inline">\(2 \in \{1,2\}\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>By definition of power set, elements of <span
class="math inline">\(W\)</span> are subsets of <span

<span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is an element of <span

<p>In your proofs and disproofs of statements below, justify each step
by reference to a component of the following proof strategies we have
discussed so far, and/or to relevant definitions and calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A counterexample can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>false</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A witness can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>true</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of universal by exhaustion</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a finite domain,
evaluate the predicate at <span><strong>each</strong></span> domain
element to confirm that it is always T.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by universal generalization</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true, we can take an arbitrary element <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> from the domain and show that <span
class="math inline">\(P(e)\)</span> is true, without making any
assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> other than that
it comes from the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span>
is <span><strong>false</strong></span>, write the universal statement
that is logically equivalent to its negation and then prove it true
using universal generalization.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Strategies for conjunction</strong></span>: To
prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is true, have
two subgoals: subgoal (1) prove <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is true; and, subgoal (2) prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
is true. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is
false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is false. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span>
is false, it’s enough to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Direct
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show
<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Contrapositive
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(\neg q\)</span> is true and use that assumption to
show <span class="math inline">\(\neg p\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of disjuction using equivalent
conditional</strong></span>: To prove that the disjunction <span
class="math inline">\(p \lor q\)</span> is true, we can rewrite it
equivalently as <span class="math inline">\(\lnot p \to q\)</span> and
then use direct proof or contrapositive proof.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Cases</strong></span>: To prove <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> when we know <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \lor p_2\)</span>, show that <span

<p><span><strong>Attempted proof</strong></span>: For arbitrary integers

<span class="math inline">\(n | c\)</span> and <span

we have proved both conjuncts and the proof is complete.</p>

<p>Give a recursive definition of this function, including domain,
codomain and both the basis step and recursive step of the rule. That

<p><span><em>Notation</em></span>: Using summation, this function can be

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) It

<p>Fill in the missing parts of the proof of this statement:<br />
<span><strong>Proof</strong></span>: We proceed by mathematical
induction on the set of positive integers.</p>
<p><span><strong>Basis Step</strong></span>: Choose <span
class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span> as the basis step. Using the Basis
Step in the recursive definiton of <span
class="math inline">\(sumOfFirst\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(sumOfFirst(1) = 1\)</span>. Plugging <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> into the RHS of the desired formula,
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1 (1+1)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} =
1\)</span>. Since LHS=RHS, the Basis step is complete.</p>
<p><span><strong>Recursive Step</strong></span>: Consider an arbitrary
<span class="math inline">\(k \geq 1\)</span>. We assume (as the
induction hypothesis) that <u>fill in the blank here</u>.</p>
<p>We want to show that <span class="math inline">\(sumOfFirst(k+1) =

<p><u>Fill in the rest of the proof here.</u><br />
</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) When
calculating the runtime of an algorithm, nested for loops sometimes lead
to program runtimes that involve the sum of the first <span

of growth of this runtime, it is useful to find an upper bound for this
function in terms of a simpler function. Use the explicit formula from
the earlier parts of this question and mathematical induction to prove

<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice determining and justifying whether statements are
true in multiple contexts.</p>
<p>Instructions and academic integrity reminders for all homework
assignments in CSE20 this quarter are on the class website and on the
hw1-definitions-and-notations assignment.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw6-proofs-numbers-cardinality”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are
working with for this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 6
through 8. We will post frequently asked questions and our answers to
them in a pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p>In your proofs and disproofs of statements below, justify each step
by reference to a component of the following proof strategies we have
discussed so far, and/or to relevant definitions and calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A counterexample can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>false</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A witness can be used to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is
<span><strong>true</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of universal by exhaustion</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a finite domain,
evaluate the predicate at <span><strong>each</strong></span> domain
element to confirm that it is always T.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by universal generalization</strong></span>:
To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is
true, we can take an arbitrary element <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> from the domain and show that <span
class="math inline">\(P(e)\)</span> is true, without making any
assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> other than that
it comes from the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span>
is <span><strong>false</strong></span>, write the universal statement
that is logically equivalent to its negation and then prove it true
using universal generalization.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Strategies for conjunction</strong></span>: To
prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is true, have
two subgoals: subgoal (1) prove <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is true; and, subgoal (2) prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>
is true. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is
false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
is false. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span>
is false, it’s enough to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Direct
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show
<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Contrapositive
Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span
class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span
class="math inline">\(\neg q\)</span> is true and use that assumption to
show <span class="math inline">\(\neg p\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of disjuction using equivalent
conditional</strong></span>: To prove that the disjunction <span
class="math inline">\(p \lor q\)</span> is true, we can rewrite it
equivalently as <span class="math inline">\(\lnot p \to q\)</span> and
then use direct proof or contrapositive proof.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Cases</strong></span>: To prove <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> when we know <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \lor p_2\)</span>, show that <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \to q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p_2 \to q\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Structural Induction</strong></span>: To
prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \in X \, P(x)\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a recursively defined
set, prove two cases:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Basis Step:</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Show the statement holds for elements
specified in the basis step of the definition.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Recursive Step:</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Show that if the statement is true for
each of the elements used to construct new elements in the recursive
step of the definition, the result holds for these new elements.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Mathematical Induction</strong></span>: To
prove a universal quantification over the set of all integers greater
than or equal to some base integer <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>:</p>
<table>

<td style="text-align: left;">Consider an arbitrary integer <span

class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, assume (as the <span><strong>induction

class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and use this and other facts to prove
that the property holds for <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Strong Induction</strong></span> To prove
that a universal quantification over the set of all integers greater
than or equal to some base integer <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> holds, pick a fixed nonnegative integer
<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and then:</p>
<table>

<td style="text-align: left;">Basis Step:</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Show the statement holds for <span

that the property holds for <span

</tr>
</tbody>
</table></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Contradiction</strong></span></p>
<p>To prove that a statement <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is
true, pick another statement <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and
once we show that <span class="math inline">\(\neg p  \to (r
\wedge  \neg r)\)</span> then we can conclude that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true.</p>
<p><span><em>Informally</em></span> The statement we care about can’t

\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\)</span>. By the assumption of this direct proof,
<span class="math inline">\(z \in \mathbb{Q}\)</span>. Thus, the
witnesses we picked are in the required domains. Moreover, by
definition, <span class="math inline">\(z = x^y\)</span>, as required.
Thus, the existential claim is proved and we have completed the direct
proof required for this case.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Case 2</strong></span>: We need to show that <span
class="math display">\[(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} \in \overline{\mathbb{Q}})
\to
            \exists x \in \overline{\mathbb{Q}}~ \exists y \in
\overline{\mathbb{Q}}
            ~\exists z\in \mathbb{Q} ~(x^y = z)\]</span> Assume towards
a direct proof that <span class="math inline">\((\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} \in
\overline{\mathbb{Q}})\)</span>. We choose the witnesses <span
class="math display">\[x =
\textbf{(iii)}\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}, ~y =
        \textbf{(iv)}\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}, ~z =
\textbf{(v)}\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}\]</span> By the
assumption of this direct proof, <span class="math inline">\(x \in
\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\)</span>. As we mentioned above, <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}\)</span> so <span
class="math inline">\(y \in \overline{\mathbb{Q}}\)</span>. Picking
<span class="math inline">\(p = 2, q = 1\)</span>, we observe that <span
class="math inline">\(z = \frac{2}{1}\)</span> and since
<strong>(vi)</strong><u></u>, <span class="math inline">\(z \in
\mathbb{Q}\)</span>. Thus, the three witnesses we picked are in the
required domains. Calculating: <span class="math display">\[\left(
\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{\sqrt{2}} = \left( \sqrt{2}
\right)^{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} }
        = \left(\sqrt{2} \right)^2 = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} =
2\]</span> which proves that <span
class="math inline">\(\textbf{(vii)}\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}\)</span>,
and hence <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> are the required
witnesses. Thus, the existential claim is proved and we have completed
the direct proof required for this case.</p></li>

<p>The proof by cases is now complete and the statement has been proved.

<p>We give a (well-defined) function with domain <span

from the counterexample: <span class="math inline">\(a =

These are ratings <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples (in the

<p>The function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is also not onto,
as we can see from the counterexample <span

<p>The project component of this class will be an opportunity for you to
extend your work on assignments and explore applications of your
choosing.</p>
<p><span><em>Why?</em></span> To go deeper and explore the material from
discrete math and how it relates to Computer Science.</p>
<p><span><em>How?</em></span> During emergency remote instruction last
academic year, we discovered that video assessement and some open-ended
personalized projects help ensure fairness and can be less stressful for
students than in-person midterm exams. Asynchronous project submission
also gives flexibility and allows more physical distancing.</p>
<p>Your videos: We will delete all the videos we receive from you after
assigning final grades for the course, and they will be stored in a
university-controlled Google Drive directory only accessible to the
course staff during the quarter. Please send an email to the instructor
(minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have concerns about the video / screencast
components of this project or cannot complete projects in this style for
some reason.</p>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here:</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h2>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast).</p>
<p>You can use any of this quarter’s CSE 20 offering (notes, readings,
class videos, homework feedback). These resources should be more than
enough. If you are struggling to get started and want to look elsewhere
online, you must acknowledge this by listing and citing any resources
you consult (even if you do not explicitly quote them). Link directly to
them and include the name of the author / video creator and the reason
you consulted this reference. The work you submit for the project needs
to be your own. Again, you shouldn’t need to look anywhere other than
this quarter’s material and doing so may result in definitions or
notations that conflict with our norms in this class so think carefully
before you go down this path.</p>
<p>The project has three parts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Part 1 of Project: due Thursday October 14</p></li>
<li><p>Part 2 of Project: due Thursday November 4</p></li>

<li><p>In Week 1, we discussed the mathematical definition of a
function, namely that a <span><strong>function</strong></span> is
defined by its (1) domain, (2) codomain, and (3) rule assigning each
element in the domain exactly one element in the codomain.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write out the definition for an example function you make up. You
can choose any example you like, so long as it is your own independent
effort and it is not a function from a class example, homework, or
Review Quiz in this class so far. Use the notation defined in class.
Label and define the domain, codomain, and rule clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the result of applying your function to an element in
its domain. Just like in homework, include (clear, correct, complete)
calculations and/or references to definitions to present your function
application.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In CSE 20 this quarter, we will be exploring the applications of
discrete mathematics for core CS topics. The following videos introduce
some of these topics and the work happening here at UCSD to explore
them. Pick one of the following videos, watch it, and then write a few
sentences answering the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Which video did you watch? Why did you choose the video you
watched?</p></li>
<li><p>What followup question(s) would you like to ask the person in the
video about their work? At least one of your followup questions should
be about a technical aspect of the work that you would like to learn
more about.</p></li>

<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills.</p>
<p>Prepare a 3-5 minute screencast video that starts with your face and
your student ID for a few seconds at the beginning, and introduce
yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t have to be on camera for the
rest of the video, though it’s fine if you are. We are looking for a
brief confirmation that it’s you creating the video and doing the work
submitted for the project.</p>
<p>Then, explain your work in question 1 of the written component.
Discuss at least one potential mistake that someone solving a similar
question should avoid (this could be a mistake you made while thinking
about this problem or something you anticipate a classmate might
struggle with); explain why the mistake is wrong and how to fix it.</p>
<p>Finally, explain any differences between your pre-survey description
of “what a function is" and the mathematical definition of what a
function is. You should have an email copy of your responses to the
pre-survey, and you can refer to what you wrote in your explanation.</p>

one of the review quizzes from 10/4/2021 (Monday of Week 1) to
10/29/2021 (Friday of Week 5) to revisit. Include the problem statement,
why you picked this question (e.g. what is interesting about it, what is
hard about it, or why you wanted to take a second look at it), and your
solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Question selection: you can pick any <span><strong>one
question</strong></span> listed in the Review sections of the relevant
notes documents, and you must address all of its parts.</p></li>
<li><p>For each part of your chosen question: prepare a complete
solution (you can use the homework solutions we post for guidance about
the style). Your submission will be evaluated not only on the
correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your ideas
clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your
conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Your goal should be
to convince the reader that your results and methods are sound. Imagine
you are preparing these solutions for someone else taking CSE 20 who
missed that week and is “catching up".</p></li>

should output a specific result or decision. Explain your answer, either
by reference to your knowledge of the algorithm itself or by
observations you make about outputs of the algorithm.</p>
<p>Give an example of how someone different from you might have a
different experience with this algorithm. Support your example with
lessons you learned in the readings, citing what you learned from the
articles.</p></li>

<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills.</p>
<p>Prepare a 3-5 minute screencast video explaining your work in
question 1 parts (c) and (d) of the written component (i.e. the negation
and proof). During your solution presentation, point out at least one
potential mistake that someone solving a similar question should avoid
(this could be a mistake you made while thinking about this problem or
something you anticipate a classmate might struggle with); explain why
the mistake is wrong and how to fix it.</p>
<p>You do not need to include complete details of every part of your
solution to these parts. It is up to you to choose what is most
important so that you can stick to the timing guidelines and still have
time to include discussing potential mistakes.</p>
<p>Include your face and your student ID (we’d like a photo ID that
includes your name and picture if possible) for a few seconds at the
beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t
have to be on camera the whole time, though it’s fine if you are. We are
looking for a brief confirmation that it’s you creating the video/doing
the work attached to the video.</p>

<p>to directly upload a video file for this assignment. It should be a
file that you can easily play on your system. One way you can determine
if this is true is if you can store it on your Google Drive and play it
from there, since that’s how we will watch it.</p>
